                Why I got into the things I like!<br>
                <br>
                Entrepreneurship:<br>
                I was always a hustler. Maybe not as the kid that sold snacks and candies in middle school. 
                But I always dreamt of earning my own income from a young age. Which is why I started a few “ventures” 
                myself that allowed me to earn a bit of money for pocket money.
                <br><br>
                Coding:<br>
                I had taken a high school coding class, where I learnt to code short little projects like a countdown timer
                 using Python as the main programming language. Now in UMich, I have taken EECS 183, which is an Introduction 
                 to computer science course that utilizes C++ as the main programming language. In that class, I realized how 
                 much I enjoy coding even though it was a little tedious.
                <br><br>
                Hobbies:<br>
                Playing volleyball and basketball<br>
                Listening to music (R&B, Soul, Blues, anything John Mayer)<br>
                Playing guitar (acoustic and electric)<br>
                Coding<br>
                Watching Christopher Nolan films or thriller-genre movies
                <br><br>
                Background on me (where I’m from):<br>
                I was born in the most southern state of the Malaysian mainland - Johor Bahru - right across the border 
                from Singapore. I moved to Hong Kong when I was around a year old, and had been living there.  I head back 
                to Malaysia during Lunar New Year, so I’d say I’m a resident of both countries!
