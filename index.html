            <h1>About Me </h1>
            <p>
                I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan.
                In my free time, I like to build cool <a href="#projects">personal projects</a>. I have also
                previously
                started a few side <a href="#mybusiness">businesses</a> and plan to
                build something substantial during my time at UMich. I’m passionate about shaping the
                future, so come
                along for the ride! <br><br>
                Apart from working out and playing guitar, I like to talk about technology, crypto, stocks,
                the economy,
                and everything in between.
                So feel free to reach out! <br><br>
                I’m currently part of a few clubs in UMich, including V1 Michigan, Shift Creator Space,
                MRacing,
                Michigan Hackers and more. <br><br>

                A Shift Creator Space sandbox project. This is a website that optimizes and streamlines the
                sloppy
                search engine through
                Reddit posts on their own website. The end goal is that it allows users to be educated and
                more informed
                on their topics of
                choice through genuine and oftentimes extremely useful Reddit posts.
